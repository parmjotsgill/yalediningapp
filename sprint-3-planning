## Dependencies & Risks

### Critical Path Dependencies

1. **Story #16 (Automated scraper)** must complete **by Day 3** before:
   - Story #17 (Error logging) can be tested
   - Story #18 (Retry logic) can be implemented

2. **Story #3 (Render deployment)** should complete **by Day 4** to enable:
   - End-to-end testing in staging environment
   - Stakeholder demos of deployed application

3. **Story #9 (Dietary filters)** should complete **by Day 3** before:
   - Story #12 (Empty state) can be fully tested with filter combinations

### Identified Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy | Owner |
|------|-------------|--------|---------------------|-------|
| Render deployment complexity underestimated | Medium | High | Allocate Louis + Sachit pairing; research Render docs before starting; budget extra 2-3 hours | Louis |
| Scraper cron job (8 pts) is largest story | Medium | Medium | Break into subtasks; daily check-ins on progress; Louis prioritizes this early in sprint | Louis |
| Thanksgiving week approaching (Nov 21-24) | High | Medium | Complete all critical work by Nov 19; avoid carrying over high-risk items | Team |
| Mobile responsive design may uncover edge cases | Medium | Low | Piquet to test on multiple devices (iPhone, Android, tablet); iterate quickly | Piquet |
| Empty state depends on filter implementation | Low | Low | Parm completes filters by Day 3; Piquet begins empty state Day 4 | Parm/Piquet |

### Assumptions
- Yale Dining website HTML structure remains stable (scraper won't break)
- Render free tier has sufficient capacity for staging deployment
- No major stakeholder requirement changes mid-sprint
- Team members have 20 hours/week availability as planned

## Notes from Planning Session

**Key Decisions:**
- Prioritized deployment (Story #3) early to unblock staging testing
- Louis to focus exclusively on scraper (Story #16) as it's the largest/riskiest story
- Piquet will handle all UI polish stories (#10, #12, #14) for design consistency
- Team agreed to drop Story #11 (dish count) if time runs short - lowest priority

**Open Questions:**
- Do we need CAPTCHA on reactions? (Deferred to Sprint 4 discussion)
- Should we use Google Analytics or Plausible? (Kyle to advise)

**Team Confidence Level:** 7/10
- Confident in filtering and UI stories
- Moderate concern about Render deployment complexity
- High confidence in scraper implementation (Louis has experience)
