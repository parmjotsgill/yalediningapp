## Assumptions and Risks
- Web scraper (#15) may require extra debugging; UI can run on seed data if needed.  
- Integrating live data could surface edge-case bugs — extra QA time allocated.  
- Finals week may slightly reduce team availability.

---

## Exit Criteria
- Menus load from database for the current meal period.  
- Dietary filters work properly (AND logic).  
- Dish count and “no matches” messages display correctly.  
- Fully responsive and tested on mobile.

**Sprint 3 Outcome:**  
A usable MVP connected to real Yale Dining data with live filters and a polished mobile interface.
